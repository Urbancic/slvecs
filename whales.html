<h1>There are no whales in Mongolia.</h1>
<p>Contrary to what you might think, Mongolia does not have wales. However there
are Mongolian restaurants in Wales. As the Mongolian borders do not touch the sea,
 wales in the wild are a rare sight. They do however have lots of other rather diverse
  forms of life such as the snow lepard, wild sheep, the Siberiean ibex, musk deer, and
  wild boors. Sadly, there are no articles stating wether there are wales in Mongolia's
  great lakes or not. </p>
