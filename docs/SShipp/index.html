  <h2>Here we will look at the 3 basic adjustments for your camera: shutter-speed, aperture, and ISO</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>Shutter-Speed</h3>
    <p>First up is shutter-speed. Shutter-speed will be written in a format like 1/100 and it adjusts how long the image is exposed to light(1/100 of a second). The lower the shutter-speed the brighter the image will be (1/10 is a low shutter-speed) and the higher the shutter-speed the darker the image will be (1/1000 is a high shutter-speed). But it isn't quite that simple. Lower shutter-speeds will cause motion blur, fast moving objects will be blurry and you will need a tripod or some other for of stabilization to shoot below 1/50. High shutter-speeds are better for things such as sports photography and low shutter speeds are better for dark places.</p>

  <h3>ISO</h3>
    <p>Next up is ISO. ISO is the camera's sensitivity to light and is marked as numbers .Put simply, a smaller ISO is better. Higher ISO makes the image brighter, but it comes at a cost. Higher ISO results in grainy images. But used in moderation ISO is a good tool. You would need a high ISO if you are shooting fast moving objects in a dark place. Also, if you have no form of stabilization you may need to bump up the ISO to make it so you can still shoot at a shutter-speed that does not require stabilization. If you do have stabilization and you are not shooting moving objects it is much better to use shutter-speed to brighten the image and keep the ISO at the lowest setting.</p>
  <h3>Aperture</h3>
    <p>Lastly, aperture. The markings for aperture are probably the most confusing of them all. Aperture is marked as F-stop. F-stop is how open the lens is to the light and the number beside the F is the distance from the edge of the lens to where it opens up. F2.8 would be a very large aperture while F22 would be a small aperture. A very large aperture like F2.8 means that less is in focus and is better for things such as macro and portrait photography. For landscapes apertures such as F16 or F22 because they mean that the whole image will be in focus. But the downside to a small aperture is that it lets less light in. Which means you need to use shutter-speed and ISO to get the proper exposure.</p>
