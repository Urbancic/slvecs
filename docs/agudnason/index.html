      Pros and cons of dogs
    </h5>
        <p style="color:blue;">
          Dogs can be the best, and also the worst. They pee everywhere when they arent potty trained. But dogs are cuddly, playful, and great for emotional support.

      Should you get a dog?

        <p style="color:blue;">
          I think dogs are a great addition to familys but be careful to train them as soon as possible, you are the dogs master, not the other way around.
