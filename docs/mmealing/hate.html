<h3> r/The_Donald</h3>
<p>Here we have another perfect example of an echo chamber. The whole subreddit is dedicated to Donald Trump and his achievement. Despite most of the news reports and comics being correct, they have lots of offensive material. I did a test to see what would pop up on my feed when I subscribed to them, and not so surprisingly they report mostly on Donald Trump. But, unlike r/PoliticalHumor, they actually have more posts than just ones on Donald Trump. It is a very patriotic subreddit, but of course it has its downsides. Like the fact often times they will be found pulling things randomly out of context for satire purposes, definitely not as much as r/PoliticalHumor but still. </p>
