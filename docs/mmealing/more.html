<h4>r/meirl</h4>
<p>There's not really a whole ton to say about this subreddit. A more proper name would probably be r/reposted_memes because that's all that it is, really. When I start browsing, all I find are reposted memes with at least 5 watermarks on them from different meme makers. They're all reposts from other subreddits and from dead memes from 2015. Right when I open up the subreddit, I start finding memes that I found 2 years ago. It seems as though these normies went onto iFunny and 9gag and decided to screenshot a couple of stale memes and post them to their favorite normie subreddit. </p>
